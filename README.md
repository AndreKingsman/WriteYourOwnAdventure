## User guide

When you start the application, you are presented with the main menu, from where you can navigate to the tutorial, or Create Mode. After you started writing your adventure, you can return to the main menu at any time and start playing.

When you enter Create Mode for the first time you will be prompted to enter a title for your story. Afterwards you start writing the first scenario. The adventure consists of a number of branching scenarios connected through options the player can choose between. Between writing each scenario you can view a summary of your adventure so far and determine which scenario to write next. For each scenario you can write between zero and ten choices. If you do not include any options, the adventure automatically ends if the player reaches that scenario.

When you play your adventure, you start at the first scenario. Depending on your choices, the story unfolds differently.
